# TODO

## Completed

- [x] Core gameplay
  - [x] Complete Sudoku grid generation and backtracking solver
  - [x] Puzzle creation based on difficulty (cells removed)
  - [x] Board instantiation with 3×3 blocks and `SudokuCell_Prefab`
  - [x] Input flow via `InputButton` and `SudokuCell`
- [x] Player features
  - [x] Pencil Mode (toggle): add/remove candidates per cell
  - [x] Pencil marks displayed in a 3×3 grid inside each cell
  - [x] Hint system: fills a correct value in a random empty cell
- [x] Feedback & UX
  - [x] Error highlighting per cell on Submit (red for incorrect)
  - [x] Auto-clear error highlight when value or notes change
  - [x] Hover/click visual feedback for cells
  - [x] Pop animation + sound on successful entry
  - [x] Pencil Mode button visual state (active/inactive)
  - [x] Clear errors support via `Board.ClearErrors()` (hook to UI button)
  - [x] Hide pencil marks when a main value is set; show when cleared (via `pencilContainer`)
  - [x] Quick actions: `ClearPencilMarks()` and `ClearCell()` in `SudokuCell`
  - [x] Subtle animation: shake on error in `SudokuCell`
- [x] UI & Controls
  - [x] Difficulty slider wired to `PlayerSettings`
  - [x] Timer (count up)
- [x] Documentation
  - [x] README centered title + image
  - [x] README features, installation, credits (Developed by Michel Duek)
- [x] Builds & Repo
  - [x] Android APK build (`Sudoku/Game/Sudoku.apk`)
  - [x] GitHub repository updated and pushed
- [x] Performance & code health
  - [x] Cache `SudokuCell[,]` in `Board` and refactor `GiveHint()`/`CheckComplete()` to use it instead of name lookups
  - [x] Optimize solver: break upon first empty cell per recursion to reduce branching
  - [x] Fix compile error: removed duplicate `bestTimeText` field in `Board`
- [x] Releases & CI
  - [x] Add root `.gitignore` to ignore `Library/`, `Temp/`, `Builds/`, etc.
- [x] Gameplay quality & performance
  - [x] Improve puzzle generation to preserve unique solution (solution counting during removals)
- [x] Feature depth
  - [x] Best times per difficulty (PlayerPrefs) and display on win screen
  - [x] Limit and track number of hints per game; display remaining hints in UI
- [x] UX polish (partial)
  - [x] Add TMP support in code (`SudokuCell` supports `TMP_Text` for main and pencil marks)

## Pending / Next Up

- [ ] UX polish
  - [ ] Migrate UI text to TextMeshPro for sharper rendering (update prefabs to assign `TMP_Text` fields)
- [ ] Feature depth
  - [ ] Undo/redo stack for moves (values and pencil marks)
- [ ] Android polish
  - [ ] Respect safe area and ensure touch targets ~48dp for number/pencil buttons
  - [ ] Sound/haptics: option to toggle; light haptics for correct/incorrect
- [ ] Accessibility
  - [ ] Colorblind-friendly palette option; adjustable contrast for error/hover states
  - [ ] Option to increase font sizes
- [ ] Code quality
  - [ ] Remove unused imports (e.g., `UnityEngine.UIElements` in `Board`)
  - [ ] Avoid reliance on child GameObject names; expose `row`/`col` via properties if needed
  - [ ] Organize scripts into namespaces and folders (Gameplay, UI, Systems)
- [ ] Documentation & assets
  - [ ] Add screenshots/GIFs to README (gameplay, menus, pencil mode)
  - [ ] "How to Play" section in-game (brief tutorial or help panel)
  - [ ] Contribution guidelines in repo (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Releases & CI
  - [ ] Create a GitHub release (tag e.g., `v1.0.0`) and upload `Sudoku.apk` to Releases page (if not yet done)
  - [ ] Optional: CI workflow to build and validate (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Unit tests for solver, puzzle validator, and hint logic
  - [ ] Playtesting checklist across devices/screen sizes
